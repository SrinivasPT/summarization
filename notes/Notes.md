# **Citation Grouping Framework for Major Compliance Requirements (MCRs)**  

## **1. Understanding Major Compliance Requirements (MCR) and Attributes**  
- A **Major Compliance Requirement (MCR)** represents a broad regulatory obligation that organizations must fulfill.  
- Within an MCR, citations may have **variations in application, scope, and enforcement**—these variations are categorized as **Attributes**.  
- **Attributes define specific regulatory conditions** that apply to a subset of citations within the MCR.  

For example:  
- **MCR:** *Compliance with unclaimed property reporting laws.*  
  - **Attribute 1:** Applies *only to financial institutions*.  
  - **Attribute 2:** Requires *negative reporting if no unclaimed property exists*.  
  - **Attribute 3:** Mandates *notarization for compliance filings in New York*.  

By defining citations within **Attributes**, we ensure precise compliance tracking under each **MCR**.

---

## **2. Key Attributes for Grouping Citations**  
Each citation within an **MCR** is classified based on shared **Attributes**. These **Attributes define specific nuances** that determine how compliance is achieved.

### **a) Nature of Obligation**  
- **Mandatory:** Requires **compulsory action** (e.g., filing reports, obtaining certification).  
- **Conditional:** Compliance is required **only if certain thresholds are met** (e.g., net worth above $10M).  
- **Optional:** Compliance is **recommended** but not enforced.  

### **b) Procedural Specificity**  
- **How to Comply:** Specifies submission formats, required certifications, or procedural steps.  
- **Deadlines & Extensions:** Defines filing deadlines, grace periods, and penalties for late compliance.  

### **c) Scope of Application**  
- **Universal:** Applies to **all entities** within a given industry or sector.  
- **Selective:** Applies only **under specific conditions** (e.g., company size, operational history).  

### **d) Enforcement Mechanisms**  
- **Regulatory Oversight:** Includes **audits, examinations, or compliance reviews**.  
- **Penalties for Non-Compliance:** Defines **legal consequences, fines, or restrictions**.  

By classifying citations under these **Attributes**, regulatory obligations are structured for **efficient compliance management**.

---

## **3. Grouping Citations Under Common Attributes**  
- Citations that **share the same compliance nuances** are grouped under a single **Attribute** of the **MCR**.  
- **Each Attribute represents a regulatory condition**, ensuring all grouped citations require similar compliance actions.  
- This structured approach **simplifies compliance management** and ensures **regulatory consistency**.

### **Example: Attributes for an MCR on Unclaimed Property Reporting**  

| **MCR: Unclaimed Property Reporting Compliance** | **Attribute** | **Citations Sharing This Attribute** |
|------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Negative Reporting Obligation** | **Required for financial institutions** | Citations mandating financial institutions to submit a negative report if no unclaimed property exists. |
| **Procedural Requirements** | **Notarization of Compliance Filings** | Citations requiring notarized reports for regulatory submission. |
| **Scope of Applicability** | **Threshold-based Reporting ($10M+ Net Worth)** | Citations applying only to businesses exceeding financial thresholds. |

Grouping citations under **Attributes of an MCR** ensures compliance efforts are **focused and efficient**.

---

## **4. Control Implementation at the Attribute Level**  
- **Control:** A **policy, process, or system** that ensures compliance with all citations under a given **Attribute**.  
- **Each Attribute has a corresponding control**, meaning one control can cover multiple citations under the same compliance condition.  
- **Examples of Controls:**
  - **Automated compliance tracking systems** for negative reporting obligations.  
  - **Standardized notarization procedures** for regulatory filings.  
  - **Threshold-based exemption tracking** for selective reporting requirements.  

By managing **controls at the Attribute level**, banks ensure **efficient regulatory compliance** under each **MCR**.

---

## **5. Prioritizing the Most Restrictive Citation**  
- **Most Restrictive Citation:** The citation that imposes the **strictest conditions** within an **Attribute**.  
- **How Stringency is Measured:**
  - **Severity of penalties** for non-compliance.  
  - **Complexity of procedural requirements** (e.g., notarization, additional approvals).  
  - **Breadth of application** (e.g., applies to a broader range of entities).  

### **Process for Assigning Citations to an Attribute:**  
1. Identify the **most restrictive citation** within the **MCR**.  
2. Determine if other citations **share the same compliance nuances** and can be grouped under an existing **Attribute**.  
3. If a citation introduces **a new nuance**, a new **Attribute** is created.  

This ensures compliance frameworks are built around **the highest level of regulatory rigor**, preventing compliance gaps.

---

## **Final Optimized Framework**  
✔ **Define the MCR** → Identify **Attributes** based on shared nuances.  
✔ **Categorize Citations by Attributes** → Ensure structured compliance tracking.  
✔ **Establish Attribute-Based Controls** → Apply **one control per Attribute**.  
✔ **Prioritize the Most Restrictive Citation** → Ensure maximum compliance coverage.  

This **Attribute-based approach** under **each MCR** eliminates redundancy, enhances compliance efficiency, and ensures **banks meet all regulatory obligations seamlessly**.
